# RES 2019 - Lab HTTP Infra

> Authors: Nohan Budry, Andr√©s Moreno

This rapport contains the different stages of the lab HTTP infra executed during the webcast ([Labo-HTTP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFO4OmcfI3U&list=PLfKkysTy70Qa1IYbV9Xndojc7L-T4keF-&index=23)).

## Stage 1

During this first stage, we've created a new folder named docker-images that contains the whole structure of the lab. Inside this folder we've created another folder named apache-php-images. Inside this folder we can find everything that we need in order to build a docker image of an httpd server (created from a docker image php:7.2-apache) with static http content (the content is located at the "content" folder).

Inside _docker-images/apache-php-images/content_ we've added a framework bootstrap, in order to add a template. The template added comes from [START-BOOTSTRAP](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/grayscale/) and goes by the name of "_Greyscale_". (This template is not the same as the webcast).

## Stage 2

The objective of this stage was to write an http application in Node.js that returns a JSON payload on GET requests. We've added a new folder named _express-dynamic_ inside docker-images that contains all the elements related to this stage (a Dockerfile in order to build our image and a src folder that contains the script). We added two modules with node packet manager (npm). The first one is _chance_ in order to genereate aleatory names, numbers, etc. and the second one is _express_ which is a minimalist web framework for node. The code found at index.js is not the same as the webcast, instead of generating students we've decided to generate adventurers and send as payload their id, name, level, health, strength and their pet.

We created two endpoints to get data from:

-   /adventurers : returns a list of 10 random adventurers
-   /adventurers/{id} : returns the information of the adventurer with the given id (a positive integer).

## Stage 3

The objective of this stage was to create a reverse proxy in order to have a unique entry point for the infrastucture. We've created a new folder named _apache-reverse-proxy_ inside _docker-images_ that contains a Dockerfile (in order to build an image) and _config_ folder containing the reverse proxy configuration (contains the path to the different containers, need to take into account that the ip adress needs to be the same as the docker containers from apache static and dynamic servers).

In order to enable the navigator to send the request we need to modify our DNS configuration by adding to the file "hosts" the ip adress and the host name (demo.res.ch).

## Stage 4

The objective of this stage was to use JQuery in order to make an AJAX request. We've added a custom script to index.js named adventurers.js located at _docker-images/apache-php-images/content/js_ that loads the adventurer's name and lvl's into an element from the html page, this function is executed periodically each two seconds (we've modify the index.js file by adding an _id_ in order to target the right header).



## Stage 5

The objective of this stage was to remove the hard-coded IP adresses inside the reverse proxy configuration. In order to achive this, we've modified the Dockerfile form *apache-reverse-proxy* making it possible to run a php file that will wirte the configuration file of the server. Need to take into account, that to be able to set the enviroment variables when starting a docker container we have to add *-e* . The environment variables are *STATIC_APP* and *DYNAMIC_APP*.
